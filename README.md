BabaBASIC lets you write and run BASIC on your Android device, enabling you to reminisce of the prehistoric computing era.

## Why I am making this?

I made this app because my father, who was a programmer in the 80s, asked me to find him an Android app to showcase programming to others using BASIC.
I couldn't find anything that I felt comfortable recommending to him, so I pulled an all-nighter and made this.

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

This app relies heavily on:
